# simple-text-adventure-game.py

# This is a very simple text adventure game
# in the spirit of Zork or Scott Adams adventures
# (though much, much, much simpler).
# For fun, try some of these: http://zorkonline.net

# This is mostly just to demonstrate using OOP and 1d lists,
# and so the game infrastructure is minimal, just enough
# to make a reasonably fun game to play.

# Have fun and be creative with your own games, but
# also be sure to understand how every method in this file
# works!
